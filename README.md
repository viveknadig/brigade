**Brigade is your personal intelligence, built on enterprise-grade tech**: a crew of
AI agents on a real org chart that share one long-term memory, Tideline, so what one
agent learns, the rest can use. They delegate to each other, switch models mid-task
without losing the thread, and act inside the 1,000+ apps you already use. It's an
ecosystem you host yourself, with the controls and data sovereignty of enterprise
tech: no account to create, no SaaS in the middle.

The same crew runs on a Raspberry Pi or a server. By default it's a small filesystem
install; switch to a self-hosted Convex database when you want one. Bring any model:
Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, or a local Ollama. Privileged actions wait for your
approval, and your keys and data never leave your machine. No telemetry.

It's an ecosystem, not an app: one crew you reach from the terminal and WhatsApp, and
from your watch, Meta smart glasses, and Meta Quest.

```bash
npm i -g @spinabot/brigade
brigade
```

Start it and you get a fast chat TUI. Keep going and you get isolated agents with
their own workspaces and credentials, persistent memory, a skill system, a cron
scheduler, sub-agent fan-out, an org hierarchy, messaging channels like WhatsApp,
1,000+ app connectors, an MCP memory server, and an optional self-hosted Convex
backend — all under one `~/.brigade/` directory you fully own.

> One owner, a whole crew — many agents that coordinate through a real org chart,
> all on hardware and storage **you** control.

## Why Brigade

| | |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Terminal-first** | A flicker-free chat TUI by default. No browser, no Electron. |
| 🧠 **Memory that lasts** | Facts persist across sessions with origin scoping, decay, and hybrid (keyword + vector) recall — the **Tideline** engine. |
| 👥 **A real crew** | Spawn isolated agents with their own personas, credentials, and memory; wire them into an **org chart** that governs who can talk to whom. |
| 🔌 **Bring any model** | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, Cerebras, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Switch mid-conversation. |
| 📅 **Always-on** | Run as a headless WebSocket gateway with a crash supervisor, cron jobs, and OS service install. |
| 💬 **Channels** | Talk to your crew from WhatsApp today; the adapter contract is built for more. |
| 🔗 **1,000+ connectors** | Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Calendar, Linear… via the built-in Composio tool. |
| 🧩 **MCP** | Expose your long-term memory to any MCP client (`brigade mcp`), or connect MCP servers in. |
| 🗄️ **Your storage** | Default filesystem mode, or an optional **fully self-hosted Convex** backend with at-rest encryption. |
| 🔐 **Yours** | Everything lives under `~/.brigade/`. Keys are stored locally at mode `0600`. `rm -rf ~/.brigade` wipes it clean. |

## Install

**Fastest — handles Node for you** (installs Node 22.12+ if you don't have it, then Brigade):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://brigade.spinabot.com/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://brigade.spinabot.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Already on Node 22.12+?** Install straight from npm:

```bash
npm i -g @spinabot/brigade
```

Then launch onboarding:

```bash
brigade
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Set up — pick a provider, paste an API key (or scan local Ollama), choose a model
brigade onboard

# 2. Start the always-on gateway — your crew, channels, and cron jobs live here
brigade gateway run

# 3. Chat with your crew
brigade tui
```

The onboarding wizard walks you through **five steps**: **(0) storage mode**
(filesystem or self-hosted Convex), **(1) pick a provider** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini,
OpenRouter, Ollama, and more), **(2) connect it** (paste an API key, validated live, or
connect local Ollama), **(3) choose a default model**, and **(4) web search** (pick a
search backend; keyless options work out of the box). Subsequent launches resume right
where you left off.

`brigade tui` (or just `brigade`) auto-starts the gateway if it isn't already running,
so for a quick local session you can skip step 2. To keep the gateway alive across
reboots, run `brigade gateway install` (installs a launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler
service).

Other handy entry points:

```bash
brigade agent -m "summarize ~/today.md"   # one-shot turn, no TUI
brigade connect                            # attach a client to a running gateway
brigade doctor                             # health-check your install
```

---

## How it works

Brigade is one binary that can act as a **gateway** (the long-lived process that
holds all state and runs agents) or as a **thin client** that attaches to it.

```
            ┌─────────────────────────── ~/.brigade/ ───────────────────────────┐
            │  config · per-agent workspaces · sessions (JSONL) · memory · cron  │
            └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                          ▲
                                          │ reads/writes (filesystem OR Convex)
                        ┌─────────────────┴─────────────────┐
   brigade tui ──ws──▶  │            GATEWAY  :7777          │  ◀──ws── brigade connect

   WhatsApp  ──────────▶│  tools · sub-agents · supervisor  │◀──────── cron jobs
   MCP client ─stdio──▶ │  (brigade mcp → memory server)    │
                        └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Clients are thin.** The TUI (`brigade`/`brigade tui`), `brigade connect`, and
  channel adapters are all WebSocket clients of the gateway. State lives only in
  the gateway; clients mirror it. Disconnect, walk away, reconnect later — your
  agents keep running.
- **One turn at a time.** Each message runs through a resilient agent loop: resolve
  the session, assemble the system prompt (persona + skills + org context), stream
  the model, run tool calls through approval and ownership guards, persist the
  transcript, reply.
- **Inbound from anywhere.** A WhatsApp message and a TUI keystroke flow through the
  same routing pipeline that resolves them to an `(agent, session)` pair, so a peer
  on one channel never bleeds into another's context.
- **It stays up.** A heartbeat file plus an out-of-process supervisor restart the
  gateway if its event loop wedges; per-OS service installers bring it up at login.

## Features

### 🧠 Memory (Tideline)
File-backed facts (`facts.jsonl`) tagged with an **origin** (owner vs. channel peer)
so a peer's facts never leak into your context. Facts **decay** on three tiers and
are deduped at write time, behind a **provenance write-gate** that stops untrusted
sources from overwriting your identity/preferences. The **Tideline** engine adds
**hybrid recall** (BM25 keyword + model-free vector lane), a typed link graph, and a
nightly reflect/consolidate pass. Auto-recall injects only origin-matched facts
before each turn. Tools: `recall_memory`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`,
`manage_memory`. → **[docs/tideline.md](docs/tideline.md)**

### 🪪 Skills
Drop a folder with a `SKILL.md` into your workspace and Brigade discovers it next
turn. Skills are **prompt-resident** (name + description injected; the model reads
the body on demand). Six discovery roots merge in precedence order with eligibility
filters for OS, required binaries, env vars, and config. 56 skills ship bundled.
Manage with `manage_skill`.

### 👥 Sub-agents
Delegate work to child agents: `spawn_agent` (single) and `spawn_agents` (parallel
fan-out). Depth-capped (default 3) and child-count-capped (default 5), with an
**abort cascade** and a completion bridge that wakes the parent when children settle.

### 🏢 Org / Pride hierarchy
Define a crew as a real org chart (`cfg.org`): members, departments, reporting
lines. An **A2A (agent-to-agent) policy** derives from the graph and governs which
agents may message which. Inspect it with `brigade org show` / `explain` / `doctor`,
or render a 🦁 Pride chart with the `org` tool.

### 💬 Channels
A typed channel-adapter contract with a shared inbound pipeline (access control,
dedupe, abort triggers, approval routing). **WhatsApp** is the reference adapter
(Baileys, QR/code pairing, multi-account, reconnect backoff).

### ⏰ Cron
Schedule recurring or one-shot work: cron expressions (with IANA timezones and
stagger), fixed intervals, or one-shot timestamps. Payloads can be a system event
into your main session, a full agent turn in an isolated session, or a shell script.
Jobs survive restarts.

### 🔗 Connectors (Composio)
An owner-only `composio` tool brings **1,000+ app connectors** (Gmail, Slack, GitHub,
Notion, Calendar, Linear, …) with managed OAuth. Set a key once, then just ask your
crew in plain language: *"connect my Gmail"*, *"post to #team"*.

**Getting the key:** Brigade uses the Composio **SDK**, so it needs a **PLATFORM** key
(starts with `ak_`), *not* the "FOR YOU" consumer key (`ck_`) that Brigade rejects. At
[dashboard.composio.dev](https://dashboard.composio.dev), set the top-left mode toggle
to **PLATFORM**, open **Settings → API Keys**, and copy the `ak_…` key. Hand it to
Brigade once (*"set my Composio key to `ak_…`"*) and it's verified and stored encrypted.
Full guide: **[docs/composio.md](docs/composio.md)**.

### 🧩 MCP
Run `brigade mcp` to expose your long-term memory to any MCP client (Claude Desktop,
editors, etc.) as add/search/context tools over stdio, owner-bound.

### 🛡️ Safety & ownership
Privileged tools use either a **per-call ownership gate** (`cron list` is visible to
peers; `cron add` is not) or a blanket owner-only refusal. The `bash` tool is gated
by a per-agent approval allowlist (`brigade exec`). Secrets in config use `${VAR}`
references that resolve at read time and are never persisted resolved. Optional
**AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption** in Convex mode (`brigade encrypt`).

### 🔀 Carrow — cross-model continuity
Switch models mid-conversation **without losing context**. Carrow carries the full
transcript onto the new model (it's the same session), **re-anchors your thinking
level** to what the target supports (preserved when it can reason, forced off for a
non-reasoning model, bumped for a reasoning-only one), and sanitizes provider-specific
reasoning blocks the next provider would reject. It works **mid-turn** (abort the
in-flight run and replay your last message on the new model) or **next-turn**. This is
what makes `/model` and `/provider` switches seamless.

### 🔁 Autonomous loops
A **loop-runner** drives an agent (or a planner/executor stage) step-by-step under hard
guards — token / iteration / time **budget**, plus **no-progress** and **repetition**
detection — and stops only when **independent done-checks** pass or a guard fires,
*never on the agent's own say-so*. Each step's output is gated through the slop
detector with a bounded repair retry.

### 🧹 Anti-slop quality gate
A deterministic, zero-dependency **AI-slop detector** scans generated text in four
passes (vocabulary crutches, cliché phrases, formulaic openers, structural patterns)
and flags **density, not single words**. When output trips the threshold it triggers
**one bounded repair retry**, wired as a post-generation hook — an objective check, not
the model grading itself.

### 📈 Self-improvement (human-gated)
Tideline ships a **human-gated** self-improvement loop: propose changes from telemetry
→ **gate on evaluation** → human approve → apply → revert if needed. Brigade also
reviews its own behavior and curates/reviews skills from usage. Nothing that affects
recall changes without passing the eval bar **and** a human approval. Throughout, the
principle is the same: *independent verification, never the agent judging itself.*

### `brigade gateway`

Runs Brigade as a WebSocket server with no terminal UI of its own — the long-lived
process that channel adapters, cron jobs, and sub-agent spawns all need running.

```bash
brigade gateway run --port 7777 --host 127.0.0.1 --verbose
brigade gateway status
brigade gateway stop
brigade gateway restart
brigade gateway install      # install as a system service (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler)
brigade gateway supervise    # out-of-process crash watchdog
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--port N` | `7777` | Listen port (also `BRIGADE_PORT`) |
| `--host A` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (loopback by design) |
| `--verbose` | off | Stream a one-line summary of every event |
| `--quiet` | off | Suppress the live console stream |
| `--log-level X` | `info` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |

### `brigade connect`

Attaches a TUI to a running gateway. Same chat experience as `brigade`, but the
agent runs in the gateway process — so you can disconnect, walk away, reconnect
later, and pick up where you left off while channel adapters and cron jobs keep
running.

```bash
brigade connect --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7777
```

### `brigade agents`

Brigade ships with a default agent called `main`. Add more — each agent has its own
workspace (persona files), auth profiles, exec allowlist, sessions, and optional
channel/account routing bindings.

```bash
brigade agents                                          # list every agent (default)
brigade agents list [--json] [--bindings]
brigade agents bindings [--agent <id>] [--json]
brigade agents bind --agent <id> --bind <spec> [--bind <spec> …] [--json]
brigade agents unbind --agent <id> (--bind <spec> … | --all) [--json]
brigade agents add [name] [--workspace <dir>] [--model <id>] [--provider <id>]
                  [--agent-dir <dir>] [--bind <spec> …] [--non-interactive] [--json]
brigade agents set-identity --agent <id> [--from-identity]
                  [--name <…>] [--theme <…>] [--emoji <…>] [--avatar <…>] [--json]
brigade agents delete <id> --force [--json]
```

`agents add` without `--workspace` defaults to `~/.brigade/agents/<id>/workspace/`.
A binding `<spec>` is `"<channel>"` or `"<channel>:<accountId>"`. Delete requires
`--force`.

### `brigade doctor`

Health-checks Node version, your `~/.brigade/` directory, config, configured
providers, log sink, prompt files, and (optionally) a running gateway. Exits 0 on
pass, 1 on failure.

```bash
brigade doctor
brigade doctor --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:7777
brigade doctor --json            # machine-readable
brigade doctor --strict          # exit 1 on warnings (CI mode)
```

### `brigade config`

Read and write the local config without opening the TUI.

```bash
brigade config list
brigade config get agents.defaults.provider
brigade config set agents.defaults.provider openrouter
brigade config unset agents.defaults.thinking
brigade config file              # print the resolved config path
brigade config validate          # schema-check the current config
```

### `brigade cron`

Schedule recurring or one-shot agent turns. Pick exactly one of `--cron`, `--every`,
or `--at`; pair `--cron` with an IANA `--tz`.

```bash
brigade cron list
brigade cron add --cron "0 9 * * *" --tz "Asia/Kolkata" --message "good morning"
brigade cron add --at "2026-06-04T09:00:00+05:30" --message "stand-up reminder"
brigade cron run <jobId>         # fire it now
brigade cron enable <jobId>      # / disable / rm <jobId>
```

A payload can be a `--message` (system event into your main session), an isolated
agent turn (`--model`, `--tools`, `--light-context`), and an optional delivery
target (`--channel`, `--to`).

### `brigade channels`

Connect external messaging channels — WhatsApp ships today.

```bash
brigade channels list
brigade channels link --channel whatsapp        # pair via QR / code
brigade channels status --channel whatsapp
brigade channels allow list --channel whatsapp  # add / remove allowed senders
brigade channels disable --channel whatsapp
```

---

## In-chat commands

When you're in the chat TUI (`brigade` or `brigade connect`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agent [<id>]` | Show or switch the agent this connection is bound to |
| `/agents` | List every agent the gateway knows about |
| `/sessions`, `/session <key>` | List or switch sessions for the current agent |
| `/model [<id>]`, `/provider` | Switch model (picker or by id), or add a provider mid-session |
| `/thinking <level>` | Reasoning effort (off, minimal, low, medium, high) |
| `/reasoning [on\|off]` | Toggle whether thinking blocks render |
| `/compact` | Force a context compaction now |
| `/abort`, `/steer "<text>"` | Stop the current turn, or inject mid-turn guidance |
| `/usage` | Token + cost usage for this session |
| `/help`, `/exit` | Show all commands / quit |

Keyboard: **Enter** sends · **Ctrl+C** stops the current response · **Ctrl+D**
quits · **↑/↓** history.

---

## Built-in tools

Every agent gets a curated toolset. Mutating/privileged tools are owner-gated
(either per-call or owner-only).

- **Coding (pi SDK):** `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`
- **Memory:** `recall_memory`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `manage_memory`
- **Sub-agents:** `spawn_agent` (sync), `spawn_agents` (parallel fan-out)
- **Cross-session:** `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_list`,
  `sessions_history` (gated by visibility + A2A policy)
- **Crew management:** `agents_list`, `manage_agent`, `manage_skill`,
  `manage_provider`, `manage_access`, `manage_channel_access`, `org` (when
  `cfg.org` is set)
- **Scheduling:** `cron` (schedule jobs from inside a turn)
- **Web:** `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `browser` (when a provider is configured)
- **Connectors:** `composio` (1,000+ apps), `oauth_authorize`
- **Generation:** `generate_image`
- **Channels:** `send_message`, `send_media` (when a channel is linked)

---

## Multi-agent isolation

Every agent has its own workspace, persona, credentials, memory, sessions, exec
approvals, and routing bindings. By design:

- Agent A cannot read agent B's session transcripts (unless visibility ≠ `self`).
- Agent A cannot send to agent B's session unless `cfg.session.agentToAgent` (the
  A2A policy) permits it.
- Memory facts are per-agent and origin-scoped — they don't bleed between agents.
- Provider credentials are per-agent — e.g. `support` and `prod-bot` can use
  different accounts.

The default policy is `visibility: "self"` (an agent only sees its own sessions);
switch to `"tree"` to let a parent see sub-agents it spawned.

---

## Providers & web search

**Models out of the box:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq,
Cerebras, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, **Ollama** (local), and **Custom**
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Together, Fireworks, vLLM, LM Studio, on-prem gateways
— anything that speaks `/v1/chat/completions`). Connect several at once, switch with
`/model`, and Brigade keeps your context across the switch.

**Web search** is pluggable and auto-selected by what you've configured: Tavily,
Brave, Exa, Perplexity, Firecrawl, SearXNG (keyed) and DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Hacker
News, arXiv, GitHub, npm, local Ollama (keyless).

---

## Configuration & storage

Brigade keeps every byte of state under `~/.brigade/` — `rm -rf ~/.brigade` truly
wipes everything it knows.

**Useful environment overrides:**

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BRIGADE_STATE_DIR` | Alternate state directory (default `~/.brigade`) |
| `BRIGADE_CONFIG_PATH` | Alternate config file path |
| `BRIGADE_PORT` | Gateway port (default `7777`) |
| `BRIGADE_PROFILE` | Named profile (`workspace-<profile>/`) |
| `BRIGADE_MODE` | `filesystem` or `convex` |
| `BRIGADE_CONVEX_URL` | Convex deployment URL (implies convex mode) |
| `BRIGADE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | At-rest encryption master key (hex) |

## Storage modes: filesystem vs. Convex

Brigade defaults to **filesystem** mode (everything under `~/.brigade/`). It also
ships an optional **Convex** backend you can run **fully self-hosted** — no cloud
account, no telemetry. The mode resolves from a sticky sentinel and **freezes once
at boot**.

```bash
brigade store mode show                                   # what mode am I in?
brigade store mode set convex --convex-url http://127.0.0.1:3210
brigade store migrate --to convex --dry-run               # preview a migration
brigade store migrate --to filesystem                     # copy data back
```

Run the local Convex backend (downloads a standalone binary, no account):

```bash
npm run convex:install   # fetch convex-local-backend + dashboard into bin/
npm run convex:dev       # backend :3210, site proxy :3211, dashboard :6791
npm run convex:codegen   # regenerate convex/_generated/ against the local backend
```

Turn on **at-rest encryption** for Convex byte columns (credentials, persona,
memory, cron payloads, transcripts) with `BRIGADE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

```bash
brigade encrypt init     # generate a 32-byte key
brigade encrypt status   # is a key configured? self-check
brigade encrypt test     # round-trip seal/open
```

See [docs/convex-mode.md](docs/convex-mode.md) for the full runbook.

## MCP memory server

Brigade can expose your long-term memory to any MCP client over stdio:

```bash
brigade mcp                 # serves the `main` agent's memory
brigade mcp --agent support # a specific agent
```

It surfaces add / search / context tools, owner-bound. Point an MCP client (an
editor, a desktop assistant, etc.) at the command `brigade mcp`.

---

## Tideline (long-term memory)

Tideline is the **model-agnostic long-term memory engine** that backs Brigade.
Where a transcript is what an agent *just said*, Tideline is what it *knows* —
durable facts about you and your work, written under a trust gate, recalled by
meaning, decayed when stale, and reconciled over time. It's structured to be lifted
out as its own package (`brigade-tideline`).

It's built to survive the three ways naive "vector store" memory breaks:

| Pillar | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🛡️ **Provenance write-gate** | An untrusted source (a web page, a tool result) can't author or overwrite your identity/preferences/corrections. Poisoning writes are rejected. |
| 🔒 **Per-origin isolation** | Owner facts and per-channel/peer facts are scoped so one principal's memory never surfaces in another's recall. |
| 🔎 **Hybrid recall, no model needed** | BM25 keyword search + a **model-free** HRR vector recovery lane, so semantically-close phrasings match offline. Plug in a learned embedder to upgrade. |
| ⏳ **Bi-temporal decay + trust** | Recency/usage decay and source-trust fold into one effective ranking score; `permanent` facts never decay. |
| 🔗 **Typed link graph** | `supersedes` / `corrects` / `relates` / `supports` / `contradicts` edges power graph-recall and contradiction handling. |
| 🌙 **Reflect / consolidate** | A nightly pass confirms repeated beliefs, merges duplicates, writes association edges, and evicts decayed noise. |

**The flow, end to end:**

```
WRITE    add() → write-gate (trusted vs untrusted × protected segment) → dedup → store
RECALL   query → BM25 + HRR vector → graph walk → decay×trust score → origin filter → budgeted block
MAINTAIN decay GC → nightly dream (consolidate/relate) → contradiction detection
```

Each record carries a `segment` (identity / preference / correction / relationship /
project / knowledge / context), a `tier` (short / long / permanent), an `importance`,
and an `origin`.

```ts
import { Tideline } from "brigade-tideline";

const memory = Tideline.open("/path/to/workspace");
memory.add({ content: "I keep a strict vegetarian diet.", segment: "preference" });
const block = memory.context("dietary restrictions", { maxChars: 800 });
```

In Brigade you reach it through the `recall_memory` / `read_memory` / `write_memory` /
`manage_memory` tools and via auto-recall (which **fails closed** for unknown peers,
so operator memory never leaks). An evaluation harness (`brigade-tideline/eval`)
measures recall@k / MRR / nDCG@k on deterministic gold sets — run `npm run bench`.

## Extending Brigade

Brigade ships a typed extension SDK. Drop a module into `~/.brigade/extensions/` and
register against a slot:

```ts
import { defineModule } from "@spinabot/brigade/extension-sdk";

export default defineModule((b) => {
  b.tool({ /* a custom agent tool */ });
  b.webSearch({ /* a search provider */ });
  b.channel({ /* a messaging adapter */ });
  b.gatewayMethod({ /* a gateway RPC */ });
});
```

Shipped slots include `tool`, `hook`, `command`, `modelProvider`, `channel`,
`webSearch`, `webFetch`, `integration`, `service`, `httpRoute`, and `gatewayMethod`.
Voice/media slots (`tts`, `stt`, `mediaGen`) and pluggable `memory` backends have
locked contracts with implementations on the roadmap. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for
how to add a tool, channel, skill, or provider.

## Privacy

Brigade is a local CLI. Your API keys never leave your computer; they're stored in
your home directory at mode `0600` and used only to talk to the providers you
connect. **No telemetry, no analytics, no cloud component.** For Ollama and custom
endpoints, requests stay on your network. The gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` by
default.

---

## Develop from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spinabot/brigade.git
cd brigade
npm install
npm run build        # tsc → dist/
```

**Run from your checkout** (npm scripts wrap the binary so you don't type `node`):

```bash
npm run dev          # smart runner: rebuilds dist/ if src/ is newer, then runs
npm run dev:tsx      # run TypeScript directly via tsx (no build, slower per call)
npm run watch        # tsx --watch: auto-restart on edit
npm link             # make `brigade` available globally → this checkout
```

**Surface shortcuts** (all wrap `scripts/run-brigade.mjs`):

```bash
npm run onboard          # brigade onboard
npm run tui              # brigade tui
npm run gateway          # brigade gateway run     (also gateway:status / gateway:stop)
npm run connect          # brigade connect
npm run agent -- -m hi   # brigade agent -m hi
npm run agents:list      # brigade agents list     (agents:add / agents:bind / …)
npm run status           # brigade status          (status:json)
npm run doctor           # brigade doctor          (doctor:json / doctor:strict)
npm run channels:list    # brigade channels list   (wa:link / pairing:list / …)
npm run skills:list      # brigade skills list
npm run logs             # brigade logs            (logs:follow)
```

**Checks** (CI runs the same three):

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm test             # node:test, tempdir-isolated (281 test files)
npm run build        # ensure the production build compiles
npm run bench        # memory / recall evaluation benchmarks
```

**Storage / Convex dev:** `npm run store:mode:show`, `npm run convex:install`,
`npm run convex:dev`, `npm run convex:codegen`.
