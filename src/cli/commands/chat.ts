/**
 * `brigade chat` — in-process TUI + Pi session in a single process.

 * This is the default subcommand and the simplest path: one terminal, one
 * process, no gateway, full feature set. Everything the user sees in the
 * conversation runs through the local Pi loop with the 6-layer wrapper
 * composition wired in src/ui/chat.ts.
 *
 * Wraps the original boot flow (auth + model resolution → onboarding-if-needed
 * → buildAgent → runChat) and surfaces a clean SIGINT chain so Ctrl+C aborts
 * a turn first, exits second.
