/**
 * `brigade chat` — the default surface. A thin WebSocket client to the
 * Brigade gateway (the single per-turn runtime).
 *
 * As of the single-path refactor, `brigade chat` no longer hosts its own Pi
 * session. The TUI is always a client and the gateway daemon owns the
 * agent loop. The boot flow is:
 *
 *   1. Refuse non-TTY environments (the TUI needs a real terminal).
 *   2. Require a configured provider/model (point at `brigade onboard`).
 *   3. Ensure a gateway is running — spawn a DETACHED one if none is up.
 *      The spawned daemon persists after this chat exits, so the next
 *      `brigade chat` / `brigade connect` reattaches instantly.
 *   4. Hand off to the shared connect TUI (`runConnectCommand`), which opens
 *      the WebSocket, renders the live chat, and forwards input as requests.
 *
 * Every turn therefore runs through the gateway's per-turn execution path —
 * the same `runResilientTurn` that `brigade agent` uses — so exec-gating,
 * memory tools, persona injection, and model-family identity guidance behave
 * identically on every surface. There is no second runtime.
