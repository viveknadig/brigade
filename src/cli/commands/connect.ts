/**
 * `brigade connect` — TUI that talks to a running `brigade gateway`.
 *
 * This is the thin client. The gateway owns the Pi session, runs the full
 * 6-layer wrapper composition, and broadcasts every Pi event back to us.
 * Our job is only to render and to forward the user's input as typed
 * requests over the WebSocket.
 *
 * Feature parity with `brigade chat` for the common path (send a message,
 * stream the reply, see tool calls, abort with Ctrl+C, switch model, set
 * thinking level, compact, exit).
 *
 * `/provider` works here too: switching among configured providers reuses the
 * `set-model` RPC, and adding a new API-key provider inline routes the typed
 * key to the gateway's `add-provider` RPC, which validates + persists it on
 * the GATEWAY side (auth-profiles.json) and hot-refreshes the model registry.
 * Because the credential write happens server-side, the TUI client never needs
 * gateway-filesystem access. Subscription / local / custom providers (OAuth,
 * Ollama, BYO-endpoint) still need the full `brigade onboard` wizard.
