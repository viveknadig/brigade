/**
 * `brigade gateway supervise` — out-of-process gateway watchdog.
 *
 * The OS service-manager (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler) already
 * restarts the gateway on a CRASH. What it can't catch is a WEDGED
 * gateway: process still alive, PID still listed, but the Node event
 * loop is starved (deadlock, runaway sync compute, exhausted FDs).
 * Symptoms: every WS RPC times out, every channel goes silent, every
 * cron tick is missed — yet `ps` shows the process up. To the OS,
 * everything is fine. To Brigade, nothing is fine.
 *
 * This supervisor closes that gap. On each cycle it reads
 * `~/.brigade/gateway.heartbeat` (which the gateway updates every
 * 30s from inside the tick loop, so a starved loop can't refresh it).
 * If the file is missing OR its `ts` is older than
 * `GATEWAY_HEARTBEAT_STALE_MS` (90s default) it kills the wedged
 * gateway via the existing `gateway stop` flow (SIGTERM + wait, then
 * SIGKILL fallback) and spawns a replacement via the standard
 * `ensureGatewayRunning` path.
 *
 * Once-mode (`--once`) is the building block: the looping
 * implementation just calls the once-mode check on an interval. Tests
 * and shell scripts can drive once-mode directly.
