/**
 * END-TO-END attachment test, driving the REAL TUI.
 *
 * Every previous bug in this feature survived a green unit suite, because the
 * units were fine and the WIRING was not. Three in a row:
 *
 *   • the `/attach` handlers sat below the mid-turn steer gate, so they were
 *     unreachable while the agent worked;
 *   • a dropped path was only turned into an attachment at SUBMIT time, so the
 *     operator watched a raw `C:\...\plant-cell.png` sit in the input box with
 *     nothing staged;
 *   • the drop hook tested `!data.startsWith("\x1b")` to avoid firing on arrow
 *     keys — but pi-tui wraps EVERY paste in bracketed-paste markers ("pasted
 *     data will always contain \x1b[200~" — pi-tui/keys.js), so the hook never
 *     fired on a single paste that has ever existed.
 *
 * Unit tests could not have caught any of them. So this test drives the real
 * `TUI`, the real `BrigadeEditor`, and the real `wireConnectUi` against a fake
 * Terminal and a fake gateway — feeding in the EXACT bytes a terminal emits when
 * you drop a file on it, and asserting on what the operator sees and on what
 * actually goes out over the wire.

/**
 * TERMINALS DISAGREE about how a dropped file reaches the application, and every
 * bug in this feature so far came from assuming one particular shape:
 *
 *   • Windows Terminal and VS Code do not implement drops identically.
 *   • pi-tui wraps pastes in bracketed-paste markers — but only pastes it sees as
 *     pastes.
 *   • stdin coalescing decides whether 45 characters arrive as one chunk or five.
 *
 * So detection no longer looks at the input's SHAPE at all — it re-reads the line
 * on any change. These cases exist to hold that line: every delivery shape below
 * must produce an identical, staged, pilled result.
