/**
 * Command lanes — cooperative parallelism for the Brigade gateway.
 *
 * Public surface every Brigade caller imports from. Internally the actual
 * FIFO + generation-counter + drain-helpers implementation lives in
 * `./command-queue.ts` — this module is a thin re-export + naming-stable
 * adapter so the upstream lift could land without renaming every Brigade
 * caller (`enqueueInLane`, `getLaneQueueSize`, `resetLanesForTests`,
 * `CommandLane.{Main,Cron,Subagent,Nested}`).
 *
 * Lane model:
 *
 *   - `Main`      — the operator's primary turn lane. TUI / connect-mode
 *                   prompts + direct-RPC calls land here. Strictly FIFO.
 *   - `Cron`      — manual cron-fire work (operator clicking "run now").
 *                   Timer-driven fires bypass this lane and run directly
 *                   in their own per-instance lock.
 *   - `Subagent`  — sub-agent spawns. Parent's `Main` lane keeps moving
 *                   while a sub-agent runs.
 *   - `Nested`    — sub-agents OF sub-agents, or work spawned from inside
 *                   a cron turn. Prevents nested deadlock when a Cron-lane
 *                   task tries to enqueue more Cron-lane work.
 *   - `session:<key>` — per-session lanes for channel-routed turns. Two
 *                   different DMs (WhatsApp A and WhatsApp B) get
 *                   different lanes and run concurrently. Inside a single
 *                   peer's lane work is still FIFO so messages 1, 2, 3
 *                   process in order.
 *
 * Same-lane tasks queue and run one at a time. Different-lane tasks run
 * concurrently. The lane is a string for extensibility — adding a new
 * well-known lane is a string-literal addition; per-session lanes use
 * `session:<sessionKey>` keys built on the fly.
 *
 * Concurrency budget: every lane defaults to `maxConcurrent: 1`. Use
 * `setCommandLaneConcurrency(lane, n)` from `./command-queue.js` to lift
 * the cap (e.g. for parallel-account inbound processing on a channel).
