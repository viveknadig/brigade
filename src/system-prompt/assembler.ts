// Top-level assembler.
//
// Section order mirrors the reference layered-prompt design for every
// UNIVERSAL section that applies to Brigade today. Memory (Primitive #4) and
// Skills (Primitive #5) are now wired (## Memory / ## Skills below). Sections
// that depend on not-yet-shipped architecture are still deferred:
//
//   - Group Chat / Subagent Context (Primitive #6)
//   - Self-Update via gateway-RPC agent tools
//   - Sandbox (host-trust v1; sandbox is v3+ on the locked stack)
//   - Authorized Senders (Phase 2 multi-user)
//   - Output Directives / Messaging / Voice / Reactions / Silent Replies (Phase 3 channels)
//   - Documentation (when Brigade ships docs)
//   - Model Aliases (no alias system)
//
// Section order in this file (top to bottom):
//
//    1. Identity opener
//    2. ## Tooling
//    3. ## Tool Call Style
//    4. ## Execution Bias
//    5. ## Output Formatting           (markdown / fenced-code-block discipline)
//    6. ## Safety
//    7. ## Brigade CLI Quick Reference
//    8. ## Workspace
//    9. ## Reasoning Format            (conditional: thinking-on + non-native-reasoning model)

  // Tone lines (default-short / no preamble / skip-recap-on-approval)
  // are lifted from the reference's per-provider OPENAI overlay — the
  // model that needs them most. Promoting to a universal block because
  // every model benefits from "no walls of text" and the cost is just
  // four prompt lines.
  //
  // Skipped in sub-agent mode: the sub-agent has a single-shot task; it
  // doesn't field operator approvals or send "progress updates", and the
  // banner already sets the "return a focused reply" bias.

  // additions. Brigade previously had two extra lines ("default to short
  // natural replies", "skip the recap on `ok do it`") that overlap with
  // the new `## Voice` block above; the duplication trained the model
  // toward MORE rigid responses, not less. Trusting the reference's
  // tighter shape.

  // 5. ## Output Formatting.
  // Markdown formatting rules — load-bearing for TUI rendering quality.
  // The TUI parses fenced blocks with a `highlightCode` hook that
  // syntax-colours bash / json / typescript / etc. The model gets the
  // nice rendering for free IF it emits proper fences (lang tag on its
  // own line, body on subsequent lines, closing fence). Compact single-
  // line emit like ` ```json {…} ``` ` is parsed as inline code and
  // renders flat — same content, ugly UX.
  //
  // Skipped in sub-agent mode: the sub-agent's reply becomes a tool
  // result the parent receives as plain text, so fence discipline isn't
  // load-bearing there. The parent's prompt still carries the rules and
  // the parent decides how to render the final answer.
  // Output Formatting section REMOVED to mirror the reference implementation,
  // which doesn't carry an always-on fence-discipline block. The reference
  // ships fence guidance only via per-provider overlays for models that
  // need it (e.g. OpenAI prompt extras). Trusting Claude / Sonnet to fence
  // code correctly without an explicit always-on rule keeps the prompt
  // leaner. If a specific model regresses on fence formatting, add
  // targeted per-family guidance in `guidance.ts` rather than restoring
  // the always-on block.

  // 6. ## Safety.
  // Constitution-style anti-self-preservation rules. The previous
  // Brigade-shape three bullets (credentials, destructive ops, untrusted
  // content) were operator-protection rules that overlap with the
  // exec-gate already enforced at the tool layer; the lines below are
  // AI-alignment rules that the gate can't enforce and that ALL frontier
  // model providers reference in their published policies. Operator-
  // protection rules can land in TOOLS.md / USER.md when needed —
  // they're persona-scope, not always-on prompt scope.
