// Section order mirrors the reference layered-prompt design for every
// UNIVERSAL section that applies to Brigade today. Memory (Primitive #4) and
// Skills (Primitive #5) are now wired (## Memory / ## Skills below). Sections
// that depend on not-yet-shipped architecture are still deferred:
//
//   - Group Chat / Subagent Context (Primitive #6)
//   - Self-Update via gateway-RPC agent tools
//   - Sandbox (host-trust v1; sandbox is v3+ on the locked stack)
//   - Authorized Senders (Phase 2 multi-user)
//   - Output Directives / Messaging / Voice / Reactions / Silent Replies (Phase 3 channels)
//   - Documentation (when Brigade ships docs)
//   - Model Aliases (no alias system)
