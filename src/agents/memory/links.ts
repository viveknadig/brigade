 * The links substrate — typed edges between memories (Tideline build Step 7,

 * A fact can point at other facts: a correction supersedes a prior belief, an
 * extracted fact is `derived_from` its source, two facts may `contradict`. v1
 * STORES and DERIVES these edges (the substrate); multi-hop graph TRAVERSAL
 * (following links during recall to pull in related context) is deliberately
 * v2 — the field + the read primitives land now so the data accrues and the
 * v2 traversal has something to walk.
 *
 * Storage note: `supersedes[]` stays the supersede MECHANISM (it drives
 * archiving in `FactStore.write`); we do NOT duplicate it into `links[]` at
 * write time. Instead {@link linksFrom} mirrors it into a `supersedes` edge at
 * READ time so a graph view is complete without a migration or double-write.

 *   • STRONG FACTUAL edges (`causes`…`relates_to`) are the closed set the LLM
 *     extractor may emit, each requiring a direct stated basis + a reason + strength.
 *   • THEMATIC `same_topic` is the QUARANTINED over-linking lane: same-domain pairs
 *     (dark-mode ~ Obsidian) are allowed but capped, low-strength, and rendered in a
