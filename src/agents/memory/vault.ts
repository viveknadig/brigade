// src/agents/memory/vault.ts
//
// Tideline Step 21 — the Obsidian markdown vault.
//
// Renders each fact as a markdown note: YAML frontmatter (id / segment / tier /
// status + typed `links` as a Bases-friendly array) over the content body, a
// `## Related` section of REAL `[[wikilinks]]` (what Obsidian's graph view
// actually draws edges from — it IGNORES YAML string arrays), and a PINNED
// region the human owns. Per distinct `subject` we ALSO write one TOPIC-HUB note
// that `[[wikilinks]]` every fact sharing it, so the graph visibly CLUSTERS
// facts around their topic instead of showing isolated, cryptically-named nodes.
//
// The bug this fixes was a RENDERING bug, not a data bug: the prior renderer
// named each note by the raw `memoryId` (e.g. `mem_mqmhnc52_eod06u.md`) and
// stored edges ONLY as YAML strings (`links: - "relates:mem_…"`), which the
// graph view never draws. Filenames are now derived from the fact CONTENT
// (readable, unique, filesystem-safe) and edges are emitted as body wikilinks.
//
// 3-WAY MERGE (the load-bearing property): the dream/system PROPOSES a fresh
// render, but a human-edited PINNED region (between the `%% pinned %%` markers)
// is spliced back in verbatim — the system never clobbers hand edits. So
// re-rendering after a dream pass updates the frontmatter + body + wikilinks
// while the human's notes survive untouched. In convex mode the vault is not
// written at all — callers gate on `mode !== "convex"` before calling
// `writeVault`.

 * fact LEAVES, plus cross-links so it reads as one web, not disconnected stars:
 *   - one note per fact (readable filename), each with `## Related` `[[wikilinks]]`
 *     to its typed neighbours (all seven edge kinds) PLUS conservative semantic
 *     bridges, a `topic/<subject>` tag, and a backlink to its topic hub;
 *   - one TOPIC-HUB note per distinct subject — links DOWN to its facts, UP to the
 *     Map, and ACROSS to its same-segment sibling hubs (the cluster interlinks);
 *   - one root MAP note (`Memory Map.md`) — the graph's centre — linking to EVERY
 *     hub grouped under per-segment headings, with each topic's active-fact count.
 *
 * `prune` (default OFF) removes any SYSTEM note (fact, hub, OR the Map — detected
 * by the sentinel, NOT by filename) in `dir` NOT in the current render set — so an
 * evicted/PURGED fact's note can't linger as plaintext on disk after a
 * crypto-shred (the integrity counterpart to {@link FactStore.purge}), a hub for a
 * now-empty subject is cleaned up, and a stale Map (all subjects gone) is removed
 * rather than orphaned with dangling hub links. A human's own vault notes (their
 * OWN Index/MOC/daily) carry no sentinel and are NEVER pruned. Callers that pass
 * the FULL set for a vault (e.g. the whole owner origin) should enable it; callers
 * passing a partial set must not.
 *
 * DURABILITY: each note is written via a sibling temp + atomic rename (the same
 * tmp+rename pattern {@link FactStore} uses), so a crash mid-write leaves the
 * OLD note — and the human-pinned region that lives ONLY in the .md (the fact
 * body is recoverable from facts.jsonl; the pin is not) — intact rather than
 * truncated. `renameWithRetry` rides over the Windows EPERM/EBUSY window an
 * indexer/Obsidian briefly opens on the destination.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT PER NOTE: a single unwritable/locked note (EACCES on a read-only
 * note, EBUSY while held) is isolated so it neither skips the remaining notes
 * nor — critically — skips the prune. The prune is the integrity step (it
 * removes a just-shredded fact's plaintext note); `keep` is computed before any
 * write, so it stays correct regardless of which renders succeeded, and so the
 * prune runs unconditionally after the loop.
