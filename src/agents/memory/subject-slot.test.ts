/**
 * Single-valued ATTRIBUTE SLOTS (subjectKey) — the deterministic correction path.
 * A fact tagged with a slot auto-supersedes the prior SAME-slot, SAME-origin value
 * on write (archive + bi-temporal close + `contradicts` link), so a correction
 * REPLACES the stale belief instead of piling beside it. Segment-independent.
 * Additive facts (no slot) are never touched. This is the piece both reference
 * memory systems lacked — it makes "supersede stale beliefs" actually true.
