 * A fact's live score decays exponentially with time-since-last-access, on a
 * half-life that's LONGER for important facts (so identity sticks, context
 * fades), and is reinforced by how often it's been recalled. Neglected facts
 * archive then prune; `permanent`-tier facts (identity) never decay. This is
