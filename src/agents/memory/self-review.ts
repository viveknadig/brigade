/**
 * Self-review loop — Brigade's continual-learning "self-learning" review pass:
 * after a cadence of turns, a SCOPED background review distils the conversation
 * into durable memory, non-blocking, attributed,
 * autonomously — the LLM decides WHAT to learn under guidance; the loop runs
 * itself.
 *
 * This module is the model-agnostic CORE: the cadence trigger, the review prompt
 * (what to capture + what NOT to), and the apply-step (proposed writes → the
 * memory store, attributed). The {@link Reviewer} seam is where the live agent
 * loop plugs a scoped sub-agent (whitelisted to memory tools) over the transcript
 * — a forked-reviewer pattern. Kept here so it's unit-testable
 * without a model + a running loop. Pairs with the feedback loop
 * (`FactStore.applyFeedback`) + the event/telemetry track (`MemoryEventLog`).
