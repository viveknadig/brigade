/**
 * Semantic relationship extraction — the LLM-judged TYPED edges that turn the
 * memory graph into a web linked by MEANING, not by the structural subjectKey/hub
 * taxonomy.
 *
 * The problem this solves: the vault renders Map → topic-hub(subjectKey) → fact.
 * Facts link UP to their hub but never to EACH OTHER by meaning, and the model-free
 * embedder rarely fires a synonymy bridge. The renderer ALREADY turns a record's
 * typed edges into `## Related` `[[wikilinks]]` — the missing piece was that nothing
 * was MINTING real edges between semantically-related facts. The model does it here.
 *
 * RESEARCH-BACKED DESIGN (GraphRAG / Mem0 / Graphiti-Zep / LangChain
 * LLMGraphTransformer / Neo4j; PKM: Zettelkasten, Matuschak, Nick Milo). The field's
 * consensus, applied here:
 *   • TYPED vocabulary (a CLOSED set: causes/part_of/co_constrains/uses/… — see
 *     EXTRACTOR_FACTUAL_KINDS in links.ts) beats a single generic `relates`.
 *   • Each edge carries a REASON (justification → precision) + a STRENGTH 1-5 (the
 *     post-filter axis). Reason is MANDATORY.
 *   • A hard GATE: link only on a DIRECT, STATED basis — never on a shared topic /
 *     keyword / category / same-person co-occurrence. Plus a MULTI-VALUED guard
 *     (different objects of the same relation are NOT a contradiction).
 *   • Thematic / same-domain pairs (dark-mode ~ Obsidian "both tooling") are an
 *     over-linking risk → kept in a SEPARATE, capped, low-strength `same_topic` lane
 *     (the vault renders these in their own "## Same area" section), never mingled
 *     with the strong factual edges.
 *   • A GLEANING pass (one extra turn: "did you miss any directly-supported links?")
 *     for recall, capped at one pass and used in the on-demand relink.
 *
 * TWO entry points, ONE judgement core:
 *   1. Post-turn (incremental) — `buildCandidateBlock` + `resolveRelationshipPairs`.
 *      The post-turn extraction sweep appends a BOUNDED candidate set (top-K most-
 *      related existing same-origin facts, via hybrid recall) to the SAME extraction
 *      prompt and parses a `relationships` array out of the SAME reply. No extra
 *      per-turn LLM round-trip — the relationships ride the one extraction call.
 *      (Gleaning is OPTIONAL here to keep the per-turn path cheap.)
 *   2. On-demand (`runRelinkPass`) — a one-shot owner-gated maintenance pass over an
 *      origin's ACTIVE facts: identify ALL genuine relationships and write the edges,
 *      so the operator can populate real edges on their CURRENT facts immediately.
 *      Cost-bounded (windowed batches + a hard fact cap), idempotent, and it runs the
 *      GLEANING follow-up per window.
 *
 * HARD INVARIANTS (enforced in `resolveRelationshipPairs`, the single chokepoint):
 *   • NO FABRICATION — a pair is emitted only when BOTH endpoints resolve to a
 *     memoryId that EXISTS in the considered set. A hallucinated id is dropped.
 *   • NO SELF-EDGES — a == b is dropped.
 *   • STRICT TYPE — an edge whose `type` is not in the taxonomy (the closed factual
 *     set ∪ `same_topic`) is dropped. Reason MANDATORY (an edge with no reason is
 *     dropped). STRENGTH filter: a factual edge below MIN_FACTUAL_STRENGTH is dropped;
 *     `same_topic` is forced to the thematic ceiling and CAPPED per fact.
 *   • ORIGIN-SCOPED — the considered set is pre-filtered to ONE origin by the caller,
 *     and `linkRelated` is same-origin by contract; an edge can never relate
 *     owner↔channel.
 *   • DEDUPED — duplicate/mirror pairs collapse; `linkRelated` is itself idempotent
 *     (it skips an edge already present), so re-running writes nothing new.
