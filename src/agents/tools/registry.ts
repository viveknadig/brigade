 * Brigade tool registry.
 *
 * Factory that builds the array of Brigade-native custom tools passed to
 * Pi's `createAgentSession({customTools})` slot. Today (Primitive #3 v1)
 * the registry is empty — Pi's 5 built-in tools (`read`, `bash`, `edit`,
 * `write`, `grep`) cover the v1 surface, and the 3 Brigade-native tools
 * (`write_memory`, `recall_memory`, `spawn_agent`) ship in Primitives
 * #4-6 alongside their respective primitives.
 *
 * The factory is plumbed through to `agent-loop.ts` and `core/agent.ts`
 * now so that adding a tool later is a one-line change in
 * `createBrigadeTools` rather than a multi-file rewire.
 *
 * Mirrors OpenClaw's pattern at `src/agents/openclaw-tools.ts:51-114`
 * (`createOpenClawTools` factory) with Brigade-native naming + a much
 * narrower scope (no plugins, no channels, no MCP).

/**
 * Options threaded through to every Brigade-native tool. Each tool

 * Per-field rationale:
 *   - `workspaceDir` — the absolute path to `~/.brigade/workspace/`.
 *     Persona-mutating tools (write_memory, recall_memory) resolve
 *     their target files under this root. The agent's session cwd
 *     defaults to this dir so Pi's built-in write/edit/read resolve
 *     relative paths into it naturally; Brigade-native tools take it
 *     as an explicit parameter so they're not coupled to that default.
 *   - `agentId` — the active agent id (default `"main"`). Sub-agent
 *     tools (`spawn_agent`) use this to scope nested sessions.
 *   - `cwd` — process cwd. Tools that need to resolve relative paths
 *     for read-only operations (grep / ls equivalents) can choose to
 *     resolve against cwd OR workspaceDir depending on intent.
