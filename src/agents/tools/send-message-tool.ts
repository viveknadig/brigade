/**
 * `send_message` — agent-callable channel outbound. Owner-only.
 *
 * Lets the agent send a text message via any started channel adapter mid-
 * turn. Before this tool existed, the only way for the agent to "send
 * Bhasvanth a WhatsApp" was to schedule a cron — which is the wrong
 * primitive for "do it right now". This tool covers the immediate path;
 * `cron` covers the scheduled path.
 *
 * Defaults:
 *   - When `channel`/`to` aren't passed AND the calling turn came from a
 *     channel-routed inbound (the channel manager wired up
 *     `channelContext`), this tool auto-fills both fields with the
 *     originating chat. That means in a WhatsApp DM the agent can call
 *     `send_message({text: "..."})` to reply IN-PLACE without needing to
 *     remember the peer id. This matches the cron tool's same auto-fill
 *     behaviour.
 *   - When EITHER `channel` or `to` is explicitly set, BOTH must be set;
 *     mismatched auto-fill (e.g. channel from context + operator-supplied
 *     to) would silently cross wires.
 *
 * Validation:
 *   - `channel` must match a STARTED adapter (typo refusal via the channel
 *     manager's `adapter(id)` lookup — `whatapp` returns undefined and the
 *     tool refuses with a clear message including the started-channel
 *     list).
 *   - Sub-agents cannot send — `ownerOnly: true`. A sub-agent that needs to
 *     send a message asks the parent to do it via spawn_agent's reply.
 *
 * Pattern note: the reference has a single polymorphic `message` tool with many
 * actions (send/react/poll/sendAttachment/...). Brigade ships with just
 * `send` today; future actions (react, edit, poll) get added as separate
 * tools (`react_to_message`, `edit_message`, etc.) rather than inflating
 * one tool's schema with action-mode branches — simpler for the model
 * to reason about, and lets us add ownerOnly granularity per action.
