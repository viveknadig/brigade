/**
 * `cron` — agent-callable scheduler control tool. Owner-only.
 *
 * Lets the operator (via the chat/connect TUI) manage scheduled jobs:
 *   - `status`  — service-level snapshot (job count, next wake, running).
 *   - `list`    — paginated job list.
 *   - `add`     — create a new job. Schedule + payload + delivery in one call.
 *   - `update`  — patch one job by id.
 *   - `remove`  — delete one job by id.
 *   - `run`     — fire one job NOW (force or only-if-due).
 *   - `runs`    — fetch run history for one job.
 *   - `wake`    — inject a system-event string into the operator's main session.
 *
 * Reaches the cron service via the process-wide `getActiveCronService()`
 * singleton. The tool refuses politely if the daemon hasn't been booted
 * (so unit tests + standalone CLI invocations get a clear error rather
 * than a confusing exception).
 *
 * Ownership: `ownerOnly: true` — sub-agents and non-operator senders cannot
 * mutate the cron set. Their `cron` calls return a 403-class refusal at
 * the ownership wrapper layer, before the action even runs.

 *      - no `mode` set at all, OR
 *      - `mode === "announce"` (the autofill default for agentTurn)
 *   4. NEITHER `delivery.channel` NOR `delivery.to` is explicitly set
 *      (operator either omitted delivery entirely OR specified mode but
 *      not the targeting — we treat both as "use my current chat")
