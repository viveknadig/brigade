/**
 * `send_media` — agent-callable channel attachment send. Owner-only.
 *
 * Same shape + same auto-routing as `send_message`, but for media
 * attachments: PNG / JPG / PDF / MP4 / audio / voice / sticker / etc.
 * Reads bytes from a local path and hands the file to the channel
 * adapter's `sendMedia` capability (defined in
 * `agents/extensions/types.ts → OutboundMedia`).
 *
 * Why a separate tool:
 *   - Different parameter shape (file path + caption vs. raw text)
 *   - Different failure modes (file-not-found, channel-without-media,
 *     unsupported kind) deserve dedicated error messages
 *   - Per the `send_message` pattern note, future channel verbs ship
 *     as their own tools rather than as `action:` modes on one
 *     polymorphic tool — easier for the model to reason about and
 *     gives us per-action `ownerOnly` granularity.
 *
 * End-to-end use case this unlocks:
 *   1. User on WhatsApp: "show me the org structure"
 *   2. LLM calls `org({action:"show", format:"image"})` → gets
 *      `{imagePath, mimeType}` back
 *   3. LLM calls `send_media({path: imagePath, caption: "Here's the
 *      Pride."})` → image arrives inline in the user's WhatsApp
 *
 * Validation:
 *   - Path must exist and be readable.
 *   - Channel adapter MUST expose `sendMedia` (some adapters are
 *     text-only — tool refuses with a clear "channel X doesn't
 *     support media; the file is at <path>").
 *   - Owner-only — sub-agents cannot send media; they ask the
 *     parent via spawn_agent's reply if they have something to
 *     attach.
 *   - Same channel/to auto-fill as `send_message` (BOTH from
 *     channelContext when neither is supplied; strict pairing when
 *     either is set).
 *
 * Kind inference:
 *   - When `kind` is omitted, infer from the file extension: png/jpg
 *     /gif/webp → image, mp4/mov → video, mp3/m4a → audio, ogg/opus
 *     → voice, pdf/docx/csv/etc → document, webp-anim (we treat as
 *     image; sticker requires explicit `kind:"sticker"`).
 *   - When inference fails AND kind is omitted, refuses with the
 *     known-extension list.
