/**
 * Brigade extension seam — the contracts every capability plugs into.
 *
 * Brigade's plugin layer = Pi 0.73's native extension engine (agent-level:
 * tools / hooks / commands / model providers) + thin Brigade "capability
 * registries" for the product surfaces Pi has no concept of (channels, voice,
 * media, integrations, memory backends). A single **module** registers across
 * both through one context (`BrigadeExtensionContext`); the loader records each
 * registration, replays the agent-level ones into every Pi session as an
 * `ExtensionFactory`, and hands the product-level ones to the gateway.
 *
 * THE NO-REWRITE GUARANTEE: every capability contract below is fixed HERE, once.
 * Adding a Slack channel, a background service, an HTTP webhook, or an RPC method
 * means writing a module that calls `b.channel(...)` / `b.service(...)` /
 * `b.httpRoute(...)` / `b.gatewayMethod(...)` — the gateway already consumes those
 * registries, so existing code never changes. Voice (`b.tts`/`b.stt`) and media
 * (`b.mediaGen`) contracts are likewise fixed; the gateway surfaces them today via
 * `system.capabilities`, and the turn-time synthesis/transcription wiring lands
 * with the Voice/Media phase against these same shapes.
 *
 * Provides a full plugin-API register surface, but realized as Pi extensions +
 * light capability registries instead of a bespoke engine.
