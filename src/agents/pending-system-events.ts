/**
 * Per-session pending-system-events queue.
 *
 * Brigade follows a two-track delivery model for cron announces (and any
 * other out-of-band system event the gateway needs to surface to the
 * operator):
 *
 *   TRACK 1 — live visibility. When `enqueueSystemEvent` fires, the
 *   gateway broadcasts a `system-event` WebSocket event. A connected
 *   connect-mode TUI renders it instantly as a Brigade-side chat bubble
 *   (see `cli/commands/connect.ts`'s `system-event` handler). This is
 *   the "you literally see the reminder pop up" path.
 *
 *   TRACK 2 — model awareness (this module). The text ALSO lands in a
 *   per-session in-memory queue keyed by the operator's session key.
 *   On the next agent turn for that session, `drainPendingSystemEvents`
 *   pulls the queued events and prepends them as `<system_event>`
 *   blocks to the user message. The model then KNOWS the cron's
 *   reminder fired and can respond accordingly ("yes — that was the
 *   reminder I set for you 2 minutes ago"). Without this the model
 *   would be answering blind and might bullshit "should be landing
 *   any moment now" while the actual fire happened minutes ago.
 *
 * Storage is module-level + ephemeral on purpose: the queue is bounded
 * (20 events per session — plenty for any human-paced reminder cadence),
 * never persisted to disk, and is dropped when the process restarts.
 * Persistence would be over-engineering for what's a "don't lose this
 * one tick of state" buffer.
