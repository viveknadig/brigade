/**
 * Approval bridge — seam between Brigade's per-turn exec-gate and any
 * surface that can ask an operator "do you want to allow this?".
 *
 * The gateway plugs in an `InMemoryApprovalBridge` at boot and broadcasts
 * `approval-request` events via the gateway WS to connected TUI clients.
 * The TUI renders an inline prompt (Y/A/P/N keys) and replies via the
 * `approval-resolve` request; the bridge resolves the corresponding
 * pending Promise so the exec-gate can return `allow`/`deny` to Pi.
 *
 * Why a module-level singleton — not threading the bridge through every
 * function arg: the gateway is one process, the bridge is one instance,
 * every per-turn `makeExecGate` call needs the SAME object. Threading it
 * through 8 layers of args (server → resilientTurn → singleTurn →
 * composeBrigadeBeforeToolCall → makeExecGate) doubles the surface for
 * zero added correctness. Tests can `setActiveApprovalBridge(null)` in
 * afterEach to restore the default (no-op) bridge.
 *
 * Default bridge is null → exec-gate falls back to the legacy "refuse +
 * tell the model to ask the user" path, matching pre-2026-05-24 behaviour
 * for anything that boots without a gateway (CLI `brigade agent`, tests).
