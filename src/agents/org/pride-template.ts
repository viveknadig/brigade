/**
 * Brigade Pride hierarchy template — the single source of truth for
 * org-chart rendering.
 *
 * Brigade taunt: "Run it like a pride, not a pyramid." The display is
 * deliberately flattened to THREE tiers regardless of how deep the
 * underlying org graph nests:
 *
 *   Tier 1 — Higher Office: the `topOrder` agent (exactly 1).
 *   Tier 2 — Department leads: direct reports of `topOrder` that are
 *            heads of a department (resolved via
 *            `cfg.org.departmentHeads` pin, OR computed as the most-
 *            senior member of each department — i.e. the member with
 *            the shortest manager-chain to `topOrder`, tiebroken
 *            alphabetically).
 *   Tier 3 — Team: every other member of each department, FLATTENED.
 *            Middle managers that sit between a department lead and a
 *            leaf agent are HIDDEN by display — the leaf appears
 *            directly under its lead. The derived A2A graph is NOT
 *            changed; only the chart is collapsed.
 *
 * Callers:
 *
 *   - TUI `/org` slash command
 *   - Channel handlers (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord — anywhere a
 *     monospace code block renders)
 *   - Model-facing `org({action:"show"})` tool
 *
 * All three call into the same `renderPrideChart` (or its channel
 * wrapper) so the chart shape can never drift between surfaces.
 *
 * NO breaking changes are introduced to the `/agents` slash command or
 * the `agents_list` tool — they keep their existing flat output. The
 * Pride chart is an ADDITIVE rendering layer.

 *   2. For each department, the lead is resolved by, in order:
 *        a. Operator pin (`cfg.org.departmentHeads[slug]`) — but the
 *           graph type doesn't carry that pin, so callers that have it
 *           should pre-resolve and call `flattenToThreeTiersWithPins`;
 *           the bare flatten falls through to (b) when no pin map is
 *           supplied. See `flattenToThreeTiers` below — the bare form
 *           uses (b) only.
 *        b. Most-senior member: shortest manager-chain length to
 *           `topOrder`. Tiebroken alphabetically by id.
 *        c. If neither (a) nor (b) yield a member, the first
 *           alphabetical member of the department is the implicit
 *           lead.
 *   3. Every other member of the department is placed in `team`,
 *      ALPHABETICAL by id. Middle managers and sub-middle managers
 *      collapse — they appear as ordinary team members under the
 *      lead.
 *   4. A member whose manager-chain does NOT terminate at `topOrder`
 *      (orphaned) is folded into the closest department: walk up the
 *      reportsTo chain until an ancestor that IS a department lead is
 *      reached, and place the member in that lead's department. If no
 *      such ancestor exists, the member's own `member.department`
 *      bucket is used. If even that fails, the bucket "unassigned" is
