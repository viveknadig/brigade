// Tool-plane wiring for the claude-cli harness backend (memory/graph).
//
// The `claude` binary runs its OWN agent loop, so Brigade's tools can't be
// passed inline the way a raw model API (anthropic/openai/ollama) accepts them.
// The binary's official mechanism for external tools is MCP (`--mcp-config`).
// This module is the bridge: for an ELIGIBLE claude-cli turn we hand the binary
// an MCP config pointing back at Brigade's OWN memory MCP server
// (`brigade mcp --agent <id>` — the same server `brigade mcp` already ships for
// desktop MCP clients), so the free-tier engine can call
// `mcp__brigade__memory_add / memory_search / memory_context` and the memory
// graph becomes live on this backend.
//
// SCOPING (load-bearing — the whole design):
//   • claude-cli ONLY. The stamp is applied inside the per-dispatch stream-fn
//     wrapper and gated on `model.api === "claude-cli"`, so raw-API providers
//     (where Pi drives the loop and passes tools inline) never see any of this.
//   • OWNER turns only. The bundled memory MCP server is owner-origin pinned;
//     handing it to a channel peer's turn would let the peer read/write owner
//     memory and break Tideline's origin isolation. `senderIsOwner` is stamped
//     by the agent loop (the same signal the tool registry gates on) and
//     enforced here — a peer turn simply gets no MCP config.
//   • NEVER on structured (distiller) turns. The memory-extraction /
//     consolidation subagents are deliberately tool-less on every backend
//     (`makeIsolatedLlm` passes `tools: []`); a distiller that could call tools
//     mid-extraction would be a regression. `stream.ts` gates on
//     `isStructuredJsonPrompt` before building the config.
//   • FAIL-OPEN. Any missing precondition (no CLI entry path, bad agent id,
//     config write failure) yields "no MCP config" — the spawn proceeds exactly
//     as before (chat works, tools absent). The tool-plane can only ADD.
