/**
 * Process-singleton agent event bus.
 *
 * A global listener registry that survives Pi `AgentSession` recreation
 * across turns. The bus lets multiple consumers (the in-process TUI, the
 * gateway's WebSocket broadcaster, debug logs, future plugins) subscribe
 * ONCE at process boot and receive events from every turn that runs in
 * this process.
 *
 * Architecture choice: a global module-level Set is fine for Brigade's
 * locked single-process v1. Phase 2 (multi-user / DB-backed) will
 * either keep this and key events by `agentId` + `sessionId`, or move
 * to a per-tenant emitter — that's a Phase 2 design decision, not
 * something to over-build today.
 *
 * Event taxonomy:
 *   - `pi` events forward Pi `AgentSessionEvent` 1:1 (typed as `unknown`
 *     here to avoid a hard type dep — consumers cast as needed). This
 *     is what the gateway broadcasts to WebSocket clients today.
 *   - Brigade-native lifecycle events (`turn-start`, `turn-settled`,
 *     `turn-aborted`, `tool-blocked`, `slash-handled`, `model-switched`)
 *     mark moments Pi doesn't surface directly. Consumers use them to
 *     render spinners, log refusals, etc.
 *
 * Listener isolation: a throwing listener is logged but does NOT block
 * other listeners. Pi events fire frequently; one buggy subscriber
 * shouldn't take down the rest.
