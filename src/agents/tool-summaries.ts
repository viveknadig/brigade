// Tool summaries used in the system prompt's `## Tooling` section.
//
// The summaries are short, action-oriented one-liners — they tell the model
// what each tool DOES, not how it works. Verbose docs belong in the model's
// own tool-schema introspection (Pi attaches the full ToolDefinition to the
// API request); the system prompt's job is to advertise the surface area
// so the model picks the right name on the first try and doesn't invent
// aliases like `cat` or `ls -la`.
//
// Short, action-oriented summaries by tool name. When Pi adds a tool name
// we don't recognise, the renderer falls back to "no summary" and lets
// the model rely on its tool schema.
