/**
 * Per-agent last-used channel registry.
 *
 * When a cron's `delivery.mode === "announce"` is created from a turn
 * that DID NOT have an explicit channel target (typical TUI / connect-mode
 * scheduling), the channel auto-fill in cron-tool.ts skips — leaving the
 * job with `{mode: "announce"}` and no `channel`/`to`. At fire time, the
 * timer's `maybeDeliverAnnounce` then has no obvious target.
 *
 * OC handles this by remembering the operator's most recently active
 * channel: every channel inbound updates a per-session `lastChannel` field
 * in session metadata. When a cron fires without an explicit channel, the
 * delivery resolver reads `lastChannel` and announces there — so a
 * reminder scheduled from TUI but most-recently-active on WhatsApp lands
 * back in WhatsApp.
 *
 * Brigade mirrors that pattern here. The registry is intentionally simple:
 *
 *   - In-memory map keyed by agentId.
 *   - Records `{channelId, conversationId, threadId?, updatedAtMs}`.
 *   - Updated by every channel-routed inbound that reaches dispatch.
 *   - Read by cron's announce delivery as a last-resort target when
 *     `delivery.channel`/`to` are unset.
 *
 * Persistence is in-memory only — same scope as `pending-system-events`.
 * On gateway restart the registry empties; the first channel inbound
 * after restart populates it. This is fine because the operator's
 * channels reconnect on boot anyway, and the FIRST DM through any of
 * them re-establishes the last-channel pin before the cron service has
 * had time to fire anything that would need it.
