/**
 * Exec gate — refuses problematic shell-tool calls BEFORE they execute.
 *
 * Wired into Pi's `session.agent.beforeToolCall` hook AFTER the
 * unknown-tool guard. Composed in `agent-loop.ts`:
 *
 *   const nameGuard = makeUnknownToolGuard(enabledToolNames);
 *   const gate      = makeExecGate({ ctxRef, displayCwd });
 *   session.agent.beforeToolCall = async (ctx, signal) => {
 *     const named = await nameGuard(ctx, signal);
 *     if (named?.block) return named;
 *     return gate(ctx, signal);
 *   };
 *
 * Scope is shell-only. Path-mutating tools (`write`, `edit`) are NOT
 * gated here — Pi resolves their relative paths against the session
 * cwd (the agent's workspace dir), and absolute paths are passed
 * through. The agent's "home" is its persona directory; project files
 * are reached via absolute paths the operator gives it. This matches the
 * `tools.fs.workspaceOnly = false` default and `createAgentSession({cwd:
 * resolvedWorkspace})` wiring.
 *
 * What this gate enforces:
 *
 *   1. Tool name match — case-insensitive lookup against
 *      `EXEC_GATED_TOOLS` (bash, exec, shell, sh). Catches the
 *      `Bash`/`SHELL`/`Exec` casing that some providers emit.
 *
 *   2. Non-string command argument — refused with a typed message
 *      identifying the actual shape (array / number / object / etc.)
 *      so the model knows exactly what to fix.
 *
 *   3. workdir / cwd argument override — refused outright (any value
 *      or type). An operator who approved `ls -la` did NOT approve
 *      running it from `/etc`. v1 trust model: commands run from the
 *      agent's session cwd, no directory shopping. Phase 2 may relax
 *      this to "must be inside session cwd" once the analyzer surface
 *      lands.
 *
 *   4. env argument override — refused. An operator who allowlisted
 *      `git status` did NOT also allowlist running it with arbitrary
 *      environment variables (e.g. `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=/tmp/evil`
 *      hijacks ssh; `LD_PRELOAD=…` hijacks dynamic linking).
 *
 *   5. `decideApproval(command)` — the heart of the gate. Returns
 *      "allow" / "deny" / "prompt"; "allow" passes the call through,
 *      "deny" refuses with a hard-deny reason (and is never persistable),
 *      "prompt" refuses with the exact `brigade exec allow ...` CLI
 *      the operator needs to run.
 *
 *   6. `BrigadeApprovalFileVersionError` passthrough — if the
 *      `~/.brigade/exec-approvals.json` file declares a future schema
 *      version, refuse the tool call with the typed error's remediation
 *      message instead of letting the throw escape into Pi.
 *
 * Every refusal also emits a `tool-blocked` event via the agent event
 * bus. The TUI / gateway WebSocket / future audit consumers can
 * subscribe and render the refusal as a log line.
