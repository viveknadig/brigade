//
// The HARNESS layer: making external-loop backends first-class.
//
// Brigade has two kinds of backend:
//
//   LOOP backends (anthropic, openai, ollama, …) — a model endpoint. Pi's loop
//   runs in-process: it dispatches tools, emits tool events, and writes
//   toolCall/toolResult messages into the transcript. Everything downstream
//   (TUI chips, resume, compaction, memory) works because Pi did the work.
//
//   HARNESS backends (claude-cli today; codex-cli / gemini-cli tomorrow) — an
//   external agent BINARY runs its own loop and calls Brigade's tools back in.
//   Pi's loop dispatches nothing, so it emits nothing and persists nothing.
//
// A harness backend is NOT a loop replacement. It sits BENEATH Pi's loop: it
// contributes a `StreamFn` transport plus three out-of-band channels for the
// work Pi can no longer do — serving the tools (guarded), minting the tool
// events, and recording the transcript. Pi's `AgentSession` still owns the turn:
// prompt, retry, steering, compaction, reply extraction are untouched.
//
// This is why we do NOT implement pi-agent-core's own `AgentHarness` class: that
// IS the in-process loop engine (it dispatches tools itself, exposes
// `appendMessage`/`compact`/`skill`). Forcing an out-of-process loop into an
// in-process loop's interface would be a category error — the same mistake as
// modelling a harness as `runAttempt(prompt) => { reply }`, which can express
// none of: which `api` strings the backend owns, how the child learns its
// callback URL, the tool-plane token lifecycle, event minting, transcript
// reconciliation, capability negotiation, or teardown ordering.
//
// So: mirror Pi's CONCEPTS (context ownership, compaction, tools) as capability
// flags; delegate the LOOP to `AgentSession`; stay independent on the transport
// and the three channels, which are inherently out-of-process.
