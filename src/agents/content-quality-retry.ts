/**
 * Content-quality retry — after a turn settles, detects low-quality output and
 * re-prompts with a tailored steer. Two tiers (see `runWithContentQualityRetry`):
 *   - RECOVERY ("said it would act but didn't" / "reasoning but no visible reply" /
 *     "empty") → exactly ONE re-prompt (one retry recovers the common cases; looping
 *     a pathological empty turn would just burn budget).
 *   - QUALITY GATE (slop) → keeps forcing a rewrite until the reply clears the slop
 *     bar or a cap (default 3), so a sloppy reply can't ship after a single nudge.
 *
 * The slop cap bounds the compounded budget across the other retry layers
 * (model-fallback + retry-policy + stream-wrappers).
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *   - **empty** — no content blocks at all
 *   - **reasoning-only** — thinking blocks present but no visible text
 *     OR tool call (the user sees a blank reply)
 *   - **planning-only** — text matches a "I'll do X" pattern AND no tool
 *     was invoked. Only flagged when tools are actually available.
 *
 * Ported from `core/agent.ts:1140-1248` (Runtime A) — same logic, no
 * functional change. Lives here so Runtime B can call it without
 * importing from Runtime A.
