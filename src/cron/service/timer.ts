/**
 * Scheduler tick loop + per-job execution dispatch.
 *
 * Three pieces work together here:
 *
 *   - **armTimer** — schedules the next `onTimer` call via `setTimeout`,
 *     clamped at `MAX_TIMER_DELAY_MS` (60 s) so process suspend / wall-clock
 *     skew can't leave us asleep past a missed fire. We use a fresh
 *     `setTimeout` each tick (not `setInterval`) so the scheduling is
 *     anchored to actual completion time, not nominal interval ticks.
 *
 *   - **onTimer** — the tick handler. Walks the job list, finds whatever's
 *     due (or marginally past-due), spawns up to `maxConcurrentRuns`
 *     parallel `runDueJob` calls, then rearms the timer to the next wake
 *     time. A watchdog also rearms during long-running jobs so the timer
 *     can't stay disarmed indefinitely.
 *
 *   - **runDueJob** — sets the `runningAtMs` marker, persists it, calls the
 *     injected `runIsolatedAgentJob` (or `enqueueSystemEvent` for main-
 *     session payloads), then applies the outcome via `applyJobResult`.
 *     Emits `started` + `finished` events for every fire. Writes a run-log
 *     entry on finish. Triggers failure-alert if the consecutive-error
 *     count crosses the configured threshold.
 *
 * The startup catchup (`runMissedJobs`) is invoked separately by `ops.start`
 * — it's a one-shot at-restart sweep, not part of the tick loop.
