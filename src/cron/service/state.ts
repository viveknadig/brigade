/**
 * `CronServiceState` + `CronServiceDeps` — the per-instance container for the
 * scheduler. Every public function in `ops.ts` takes a `state` arg; every
 * internal helper takes a `state` arg too. There is no module-level
 * singleton — multiple service instances can coexist (test harness sets up
 * a fresh state per case; production has one for the gateway daemon).
 *
 * Two layers of customisation:
 *
 *   - `CronServiceDeps` — INJECTED at construction time. Time, logging, the
 *     event callback, the failure-alert sender, the "run an isolated agent"
 *     dependency, and the system-event/heartbeat hooks. Tests fake these;
 *     production wires them to Brigade's real subsystems.
 *
 *   - `CronServiceConfig` — operator-tunable from `brigade.json`. Limits
 *     (max concurrent runs, max missed jobs per restart, run-log byte/line
 *     caps, retention duration), failure-alert defaults, the storePath.
 *
 * State lives in plain objects (no class). All mutation goes through the
 * per-instance promise chain (see `service/locked.ts`).
