/**
 * Client-side attachment plumbing for the TUI.
 *
 * Four ways a file gets attached to a turn, all converging on one
 * `StagedAttachment[]` that rides the `prompt` RPC as `PromptAttachment[]`:
 *
 *   1. `@path` — pi-tui's `CombinedAutocompleteProvider` ALREADY does fuzzy
 *      `@`-prefixed file completion (it calls the feature "file attachment
 *      completion" in its own source) and connect.ts already installs it. All
 *      that was ever missing is the SEMANTICS — reading the `@token` back out of
 *      the submitted line and treating it as a file. `extractAttachmentPaths`
 *      is that missing half.
 *   2. Drag-and-drop — every mainstream terminal (Windows Terminal, iTerm2,
 *      VS Code, GNOME Terminal) responds to a dropped file by pasting its path
 *      into stdin. We parse the shapes they paste (quoted, backslash-escaped,
 *      `file://` URI, bare) out of the submitted line.
 *   3. Clipboard image — a screenshot has NO path; it lives on the clipboard as
 *      raw bitmap data. We pull the bytes out per-OS and spool them to a temp
 *      PNG, which collapses the case back into "a path" (see `readClipboardImage`).
 *   4. `/attach <path>` — the explicit backbone.
 *
 * ── The disambiguation rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Silently attaching a file the operator merely MENTIONED, or rewriting a
 * sentence they didn't mean as a path, are the two worst things this module can
 * do. Existence on disk is necessary but NOT sufficient — `check /etc/hosts for
 * me` names a file that really is there on every Linux box. So intent is graded:
 *
 *   at        `@token` from the file completer → any file, any extension.
 *   pureDrop  the line is nothing but a path   → any file, but ABSOLUTE only
 *                                                (a terminal drop always pastes
 *                                                an absolute path; a bare
 *                                                relative word is a message).
 *   inferred  a path loose in a sentence       → absolute AND a media/document
 *                                                extension. Source, config, log
 *                                                and data files are excluded:
 *                                                in prose those are cited, not
 *                                                enclosed.
 *
 * A candidate that fails its tier is left in the text EXACTLY as typed. And when
 * nothing matches at all, the original line is returned byte-for-byte — this
 * function runs on every submitted message, so anything it normalises it
 * normalises for the whole product (it once collapsed the indentation of every
 * pasted code block).
