/**
 * Brigade's Editor — thin Pi-TUI subclass that fixes one UX quirk.
 *
 * Pi-TUI's stock `Editor` treats Enter on a slash-command suggestion as
 * "accept + submit-immediately" (`editor.js:507-519` — `tui.select.confirm`
 * applies the completion and falls through to `submitValue()`). That works
 * for arg-less commands (`/help`, `/exit`) but is wrong for commands that
 * take a REQUIRED argument (`/reasoning <on|off>`, `/thinking <level>`,
 * `/mute <agent-id>`) — the user expects to inspect / edit the inserted
 * text before sending.
 *
 * Pi already has an "accept + don't submit" path on Tab
 * (`editor.js:492-505`). When the autocomplete popup is showing AND the
 * user has typed a command that needs an argument, we translate Enter →
 * Tab so the user's Enter on a popup selection just inserts the command
 * into the editor with a trailing space and waits for them to type the
 * arg + a real Enter to submit.
 *
 * For arg-less / optional-arg commands (`/agents`, `/help`, `/agent`,
 * `/sessions`, etc.) the user expects a single Enter to submit — same
 * as Pi's default. Two-Enter behaviour is a UX regression we explicitly
 * opt OUT of here.
 *
 * Outside the popup, Enter retains its normal "submit" semantics.

	 * Fired whenever the editor's text CHANGES, by any means.

	 * This is the hook that makes a dropped file become an attachment instead of a

	 * stdin as text; without this the operator stares at
	 * `C:\Users\me\Downloads\plant-cell.png` sitting in the input box — nothing
	 * staged, no bar, no confirmation, no reason to think it worked.
	 *
	 * It fires on EVERY text change rather than trying to recognise "a paste",
	 * because two successive attempts to recognise one were both wrong:
	 *
	 *   1. `!data.startsWith("\x1b")`, to avoid firing on arrow keys — but pi-tui
	 *      wraps every paste in bracketed-paste markers before handing it over
	 *      ("pasted data will always contain \x1b[200~" — pi-tui/keys.js), so this
	 *      excluded every paste that has ever existed. It never fired once.
	 *   2. "text grew by more than one character" — which assumes the terminal
	 *      delivers a drop as ONE chunk. Not guaranteed: stdin coalescing and each
	 *      terminal's own drop implementation decide that, and VS Code's does not
	 *      behave like Windows Terminal's.
	 *
	 * Both bugs came from trying to infer intent from the SHAPE of the input. So we
	 * no longer infer anything: the host re-reads the whole line on any change and
	 * looks for a path that names a real file. Whether it arrived as one chunk, ten
	 * chunks, bracketed, unbracketed, or typed by hand stops mattering entirely.
