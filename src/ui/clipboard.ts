/**
 * The clipboard, as a first-class cross-platform capability.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own module ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reading a clipboard is not one problem, it is four, and they do not share an
 * answer across operating systems:
 *
 *   • an IMAGE (a screenshot) lives on the clipboard as raw bitmap data with no
 *     file behind it — the bytes must be materialised somewhere before anything
 *     else can touch them;
 *   • a FILE copied in Explorer/Finder is a REFERENCE, not bytes — which is
 *     exactly why copy-pasting a 400 MB video costs nothing: only the path moves;
 *   • TEXT that happens to be a PATH ("Copy as path", a path out of a log) is a
 *     third mechanism again, and the one most Windows users actually hit;
 *   • and CHANGE NOTIFICATION — knowing an image arrived without being told —
 *     has a different, and much cheaper, answer than "poll the clipboard".
 *
 * Each platform expresses all four differently, so they live behind one
 * `ClipboardBackend` and the rest of the product never learns that PowerShell,
 * osascript, or wl-paste exist.
 *
 * ── On watching, and why it matters more than Ctrl+V ──────────────────────
 * Ctrl+V cannot be intercepted for an image, on any mainstream terminal, ever.
 * The terminal binds that key to its own paste, which inserts the clipboard's
 * TEXT — and a screenshot has no text, so it inserts nothing and sends nothing.
 * The application receives no keystroke at all. There is no byte to hook.
 *
 * So we don't watch the keypress; we watch the CLIPBOARD. Take a screenshot and
 * it simply appears as an attachment. Crucially this is NOT a poll-by-shelling-
 * out loop, which would burn ~100 ms of CPU per tick forever to answer a question
 * that is almost always "no". Each platform has a cheap primitive for exactly
 * this and we use it:
 *
 *   Windows  `GetClipboardSequenceNumber()` — a Win32 counter that ticks on any
 *            clipboard write and is free to read. One long-lived PowerShell holds
 *            the watch and only touches the clipboard when the number moves.
 *   Wayland  `wl-paste --watch` — genuinely event-driven. No polling at all.
 *   macOS    one long-lived `osascript` whose `repeat` loop compares
 *            `clipboard info`; the process is spawned once, not per tick.
 *   X11      no cheap change primitive exists. Watching is unsupported rather
 *            than faked with an expensive poll — `/paste` still works.
