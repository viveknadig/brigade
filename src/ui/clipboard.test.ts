/**
 * The clipboard backend is the one place in the product that shells out to an OS
 * tool on a hot path, so its CONTRACT matters more than its implementation:
 *
 *   • it must never throw — a locked clipboard or a missing tool is a lost
 *     convenience, never a lost turn;
 *   • `hasImage()` must be a CHEAP probe, distinct from `saveImage()` — asking
 *     "is there an image?" must not decode a 4K bitmap to find out there isn't;
 *   • `watch()` must return null rather than fake a watch with an expensive poll,
 *     because a silently-expensive feature is worse than an absent one;
 *   • and a watcher must never keep the process alive (it hung the suite once).
 *
 * The per-OS mechanics are exercised live against the real clipboard in
 * development; what is pinned here is the contract every backend must honour.
