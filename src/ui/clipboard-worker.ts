/**
 * A PERSISTENT clipboard worker — one process, held open, answering in milliseconds.
 *
 * ── The problem it exists to solve ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every clipboard read used to spawn a fresh `powershell.exe`. A PowerShell cold
 * start is 200–500 ms, and it is paid EVERY time. `/paste` was worse than it
 * looks: it asked for files, then an image, then text — up to four spawns, one
 * after another, so a paste could take the better part of two seconds. The
 * auto-attach watcher was worse still: it noticed the clipboard change in one
 * process and then spawned two MORE to find out what was on it.
 *
 * That is not a clipboard being slow. That is us paying process-creation cost to
 * ask a question that takes the OS microseconds to answer.
 *
 * ── The fix ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Start ONE PowerShell, once, and keep it. It holds the Win32 clipboard APIs
 * already loaded and serves two roles at the same time:
 *
 *   • REQUEST/RESPONSE — Node writes `SNAPSHOT|<dest>` on stdin, the worker reads
 *     EVERYTHING the clipboard holds in a single pass (formats, files, text, and
 *     the image already decoded and saved to `<dest>`) and writes back one JSON
 *     line. A `/paste` is now one round-trip of a few milliseconds, not four
 *     process spawns.
 *
 *   • PUSH — the same loop polls `GetClipboardSequenceNumber()`, a free Win32
 *     counter that ticks on any clipboard write. When it moves AND an image is
 *     present, the worker saves the PNG ITSELF and pushes `IMAGE|<path>`. Node
 *     spawns nothing at all: a screenshot is attached ~150 ms after it is taken.
 *
 * Both roles share one process because `ReadLineAsync()` lets the loop check for
 * a pending command without blocking the poll — so we get request/response AND a
 * push channel without a second interpreter sitting in memory.
 *
 * The whole thing is best-effort. If PowerShell is missing, wedged, or refuses to
 * start, every method degrades to "no clipboard" and the operator loses a
 * convenience, never a turn.

/**
 * The macOS / Linux worker.
 *
 * ── Why a shell script and not "the same thing as Windows" ────────────────
 * The Windows cost was never the clipboard, it was PowerShell: a 200-500 ms
 * interpreter boot, paid per call. `pbpaste`, `osascript`, `wl-paste` and `xclip`
 * are small C programs that spawn in 5-30 ms, so the per-spawn tax here is an
 * order of magnitude smaller. What actually hurt on every platform was the SHAPE:
 * four separate reads (files, image, text, formats) issued as four separate
 * processes, in series, for one paste.
 *
 * So this worker fixes the shape. It stays resident and answers a whole snapshot
 * in ONE round-trip, gathering everything in a single pass.
 *
 * ── Why the response isn't JSON ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Emitting correct JSON from shell means escaping quotes, backslashes, newlines
 * and control bytes in clipboard TEXT that came from anywhere at all. That is a
 * quoting bug waiting to happen, and quoting bugs in this feature have already
 * cost a day. A line-block protocol with the text base64'd cannot be broken by its
 * own payload:
 *
 *     S <id> BEGIN
 *     I <image path, or empty>
 *     F <file path>            (0..n)
 *     T <base64 of the text>
 *     X <format name>          (0..n)
 *     S <id> END
 *
 * ── Change notification is NOT here ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Polling the clipboard from this loop would mean spawning `osascript` every tick
 * — the exact per-tick process cost the whole design exists to avoid. Push stays
 * with the platform's own cheap primitive (`wl-paste --watch` is genuinely
 * event-driven; a single long-lived osascript `repeat` loop covers macOS), wired
 * separately in `startClipboardService`.
