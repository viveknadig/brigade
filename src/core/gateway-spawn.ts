/**
 * Gateway auto-spawn — ensure a Brigade gateway daemon is running, starting a
 * detached one if not.
 *
 * `brigade chat` is a thin WebSocket client to the gateway (the single
 * per-turn runtime). When the user runs `brigade chat` and no gateway is up,
 * we spawn one as a DETACHED background process so it survives the chat
 * session — later `brigade chat` / `brigade connect` reattach to the same
 * daemon instantly. Native apps and the TUI are always clients of a
 * long-lived gateway subprocess; the TUI is never the agent host.
 *
 * The spawned daemon is independent: we `unref()` it so the parent (chat)
 * can exit without tearing it down. Stopping it is explicit:
 * `brigade gateway stop`.
