/**
 * Gateway-side resolution of the files a client attached to a `prompt` turn.
 *
 * The TUI sends PATHS, not bytes (see `PromptAttachment` in `protocol.ts`).
 * This module turns that wire list into the `InboundMediaAttachment[]` the
 * channel inbound pipeline already speaks, so the turn can then run through the
 * SAME `buildMediaNote` + `buildInboundImageBlocks` pair a WhatsApp photo runs
 * through. Everything downstream — inline vision blocks on a vision-capable
 * model, STT transcription of a voice note, the `analyze_media` call-to-action
 * for a PDF — is inherited, not reimplemented.
 *
 * ── On trust ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The paths arrive over the wire, and we read bytes off them. That is NOT a new
 * privilege: `prompt` is already an operator-privileged RPC (it runs a turn as
 * the agent, and the agent holds `read`/`bash`), and it passes the same
 * `sessionsAccessCheck` gate as `sessions.send`. A caller who can invoke
 * `prompt` can already ask the agent to read any file it likes, in English.
 *
 * So the checks below are NOT an authorization boundary — they are a
 * FOOTGUN boundary. They exist to make a malformed attachment list fail loudly
 * and cheaply instead of wedging a turn: no directories (a stray `@src/`
 * completion), no device/FIFO files, no unbounded reads.
 *
 * Two limits on how much they can promise, stated plainly so nobody trusts them
 * further than they deserve:
 *
 *   • The regular-file check is a `stat` taken BEFORE the bytes are read (the
 *     reads happen later, inside the media helpers). Swapping the path for a
 *     FIFO in that window would still hang the read. Closing that race properly
 *     needs an open-then-fstat, which is not worth it for a surface the operator
 *     already has `bash` on — but the property is "rejects a FIFO you named",
 *     not "cannot be made to read a FIFO".
 *   • `rejected` is returned to the CALLER, which is not the same as reaching
 *     the operator's eyes. The `prompt` RPC's response carries no payload, so a
 *     partial rejection is logged gateway-side only. The TUI's defence is that
 *     it validates and count-caps files at STAGING time, before they ever get
 *     here — so a gateway rejection means something changed underneath (the file
 *     was deleted mid-turn), not that the operator over-attached.

 * written to defend itself — because in the channel pipeline they only ever saw
 * bytes an adapter had already downloaded and bounded. Handing them arbitrary
 * operator-chosen paths is a new situation:
 *
 *   • `buildInboundImageBlocks` reads an image FULLY and only THEN compares it
 *     against its 8 MiB inline cap. A 500 MB PNG is a 500 MB allocation that is
 *     immediately thrown away.
 *   • `buildMediaNote` reads an audio/voice file FULLY with no size check at all
 *     and posts it to the STT provider — whose own limit is ~25 MB. A 300 MB WAV
 *     is a 300 MB read followed by a doomed 300 MB upload, with the operator's
 *     `prompt` RPC blocked on it (the TUI sends `timeoutMs: 0`).
 *
 * The fix deliberately RECLASSIFIES rather than rejects. An oversized image or
 * recording is still attached — it just travels as a `document`, which means the
 * eager readers skip it and `analyze_media` (which does a bounded read and can
 * decline politely) handles it instead. You can still attach a 400 MB video or a
 * 60 MB photo; you simply get a tool-mediated answer rather than an inline one.
