/**
 * Brigade-native translator for the "No API key found for X" error that

 *
 * Pi's own message hardcodes `/login` (a Pi slash command Brigade doesn't
 * have) and dumps raw `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/`
 * paths into the user's chat. Both are direct violations of Brigade's
 * B2B-grade copy rules — paying customers see the agent gesture at a
 * non-existent command and at internal package paths.
 *
 * The replacement is a SINGLE SHORT LINE with a clear next step. Not a
 * multi-line guidance block — when the user already knows what's wrong
 * (their key isn't set), more text is more friction. Same pattern used by
 * mature production agent platforms.
 *
 * Pure function. No I/O.
