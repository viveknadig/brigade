/**
 * Brigade gateway wire protocol.
 *
 * Single WebSocket connection per client. Three frame types travel over
 * the same connection:
 *
 *   1. REQUEST  (client → server) — caller expects a Response with the same id
 *   2. RESPONSE (server → client) — answers a Request, ok+payload OR error
 *   3. EVENT    (server → client) — push, no id, broadcast to all clients
 *
 * The req/res shape is for commands that need a reply (e.g. `list-models`
 * returns the list). The event shape is for streaming the live agent
 * state (every Pi event becomes a Brigade event with `event === "pi"`).
 *
 * Every frame is a JSON object with a discriminator `type` field so the
 * server and client can route without sniffing payload shapes. ID format
 * is `r{counter}` — opaque string, server treats as bytes.
 *
 * Compatible with: any WebSocket client speaking this JSON shape.
